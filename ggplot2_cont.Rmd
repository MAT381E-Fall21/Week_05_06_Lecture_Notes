# Data

- We will be using data from the *National Morbidity and Mortality Air Pollution Study* (NMMAPS) which is available in [Statistical Methods in Environmental Epidemiology with R](http://www.springer.com/de/book/9780387781662).
- The data can be viewed in [here](https://github.com/z3tt/R-Tutorials/blob/master/ggplot2/chicago-nmmaps.csv).
- <p> **Data Description:**
The data set contains daily mortality (all causes, CVD, respiratory), weather (temperature, dew point temperature) and pollution data (PM10 and ozone) for Chicago in the period 1987-2000 from NMMAPS. <p>
- Here are the variables in this data set:

```{r, eval=F}
`date`: Date in the period 1987-2000.
`death`: Counts of all cause mortality excluding accident.
`temp`: Mean temperature (in Celsius degrees).
`dewpoint`: Dew point temperature.
`pm10`: PM10 (More info https://cevreselgostergeler.csb.gov.tr/hava-kalitesinde-pm10-ve-so2-ortalamalari-i-85734)
`o3`: Ozone.
`time`: The sequence of observations.
`season`: season.
`year`: Year.
```

---
- We can import the data into our `R` session:
```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# full address: https://github.com/Z3tt/R-Tutorials/blob/master/ggplot2/chicago-nmmaps.csv
chicago <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Z3tt/R-Tutorials/master/ggplot2/chicago-nmmaps.csv")
```

```{r, eval=F}
#run it on your machine
#check the structure of the data
str(chicago)
```


```{r, eval=F}
#run it on your machine
#view it on the data viewer panel
View(chicago)
```

```

---
#### Add a Legend
- The `ggplot2` adds a **legend** by default when **mapping a variable** to an **aesthetic** inside `aes()`. 
- Let's **color** the plot based on _season_. In other words,
let's map the variable `season` to the `aes`thetic `color`. 
- We can see that by default the **legend title** is what we specified in the **color argument**:

```{r out.width="35%"}
library(ggplot2)
#Aesthetic mappings describe how variables in the data are mapped to #visual properties (aesthetics) of geoms. 
#Aesthetic mappings can be set in ggplot() and in individual layers.
#aes() is a quoting function. This means that its inputs are quoted to be evaluated in the context of the data.
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp, color = season)) + #<<
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)")
```
---
#### Change Legend Title

- The easiest way to **change the title of the legend** is the `labs()` layer:

```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="35%"}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp, color = season)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)",         #<<
       color = "Seasons\nindicated\nby colors:")   #<<
```

---

- The `legend aesthetic`  details can be changed via `theme()` function with the following functions:

|Axis element  |Description     | Function         | Description | Aesthetics
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `legend.title` | legend title | `element_text()` |text         |`size`, `color`, `face`, `angle`, `hjust`, `vjust` |
| `legend.text` | plot subtitle | `element_text()` |text         |`size`, `color`, `face`, `angle`, `hjust`, `vjust`|
| `legend.key` | background underneath legend keys | `element_rect()` |rectangular         |`size`, `fill`, `color`, `linetype`|
| `legend.background` | background of legend | `element_rect()` |rectangular         |`size`, `fill`,  `color`, `linetype`|
| `legend.position` | position of legend |- |-|-|
                                
---

- Change the color, size, and face of `theme()` element `legend title`:

```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="35%"}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp, color = season)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)",         
       color = "Seasons\nindicated\nby colors:") +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(color = "chocolate",  #<<
                                    size = 14, face = "bold")) #<<
```

---
#### Change Order of Legend Keys

- We can achieve this by **changing the levels** of the variable `season`:

```{r, eval=F}
chicago$season <-
  factor(chicago$season,
         levels = c("Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Autumn")) #<<
```

---
```{r}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp, color = season)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)")
```

---

#### Change Background Boxes in the Legend

- To change line color and the background color (fill) of the legend keys, we adjust the setting for the `theme()` element `legend.key`:

```{r out.width="30%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp, color = season)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(legend.key = element_rect(color="red", fill = "blue"))  #<<
```
---
- If we want to get rid of them entirely use `fill = NA` or `fill = "transparent"`.

```{r out.width="30%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp, color = season)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(legend.key = element_rect(color="black", fill = "NA"))  #<<
```

---

#### Change Legend Position

- To change position of the legend, we adjust the setting for the `theme` element `legend.position`:
- The allowed values for the arguments `legend.position` are : “left”,“top”, “right”, “bottom”.

```{r out.width="30%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp, color = season)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")  #<<    
```     

---
- Note that, the argument `legend.position` can be also a numeric vector `c(x,y)`. In this case it is possible to position the legend inside the plotting area. `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the legend box. Their values should be between `0` and `1`. `c(0,0)` corresponds to the “bottom left” and `c(1,1)` corresponds to the “top right” position.

```{r out.width="30%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp, color = season)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.5,0.5))  #<<
```

# An Overview of a Plot

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ggplotoverview.jpeg') 
```

---
#### Change Grid Lines

- There are two types of grid lines: major grid lines indicating the thick lines and minor grid lines between the major ones. 
- You can change all of these by overwriting the defaults in `theme()` for:
  - `panel.grid`: grid lines (`element_line()`).
  - `panel.grid.major`: or `panel.grid.major.x`, `panel.grid.major.y` (`element_line()`).
  - `panel.grid.minor`: or `panel.grid.major.x`, `panel.grid.major.y`(`element_line()`).
 
---
```{r}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_line(color = "blue", size = .5)) #<<
```
---
```{r grid-lines}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "blue", size = .5), #<<
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "green", size = .5)) #<<
```

---
- We can even specify settings for all four different levels:

---
```{r grid-lines-x-y}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, linetype = "dashed"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = .25, linetype = "dotted"),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "red1"),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "blue1"),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_line(color = "red4"),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_line(color = "blue4"))
```
---

- And, of course, you can remove some or all grid lines if you like:

```{r grid-remove}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) #<<
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) #<<
```

---

#### Change the Panel Background Color

- To change the background color (fill) of the panel area (i.e. the area where the data is plotted), one needs to adjust the `theme` element `panel.background`:
  - `panel.background`: background of plotting area, drawn underneath plot (`element_rect()`).

---

```{r panel-color}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "#1D8565", size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(color = "blue", fill = "pink", #<<  
                                        size = 2)) #<<
                                        
```

---
#### Change the Plot Background Color

- Similarly, to change the background color (fill) of the plot area, one needs to modify the theme element `plot.background`:

---
```{r background-color}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(color = "gray30", fill = "gray60", #<<
                                       size = 2)) #<<
```

---
- We can achieve a unique background color by either setting the same colors in both `panel.background` and `plot.background` or by setting the background filling of the panel to `"transparent"` or `NA`:

---
```{r background-color-same}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA), #<<
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray60", #<<
                                       color = "gray30", size = 2)) #<<
```

---
class: middle, center

# Working with Themes 

---
##### Change the Overall Plotting Style

- We can change the entire look of the plots by using themes. 
- The `ggplot2` package comes with **eight built-in themes**.
 
---
```{r ggplot2-theme-gallery, purl=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=7}

p <- ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
       geom_point(color = "gray30", alpha = .3) +
       labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)")

p1 <- p + 
      theme_gray() + 
      ggtitle("theme_gray()")

p2 <- p + 
      theme_bw() + 
      ggtitle("theme_bw()")

p3 <- p + 
      theme_classic() + 
      ggtitle("theme_classic()")

p4 <- p + 
      theme_dark() + 
      ggtitle("theme_dark()")

p5 <- p + 
      theme_light() + 
      ggtitle("theme_light()")

p6 <- p + 
      theme_linedraw() + 
      ggtitle("theme_linedraw()")
```


---
```{r purl=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=7}

p7 <- p + 
      theme_minimal() + 
      ggtitle("theme_minimal()")

p8 <- p + 
      theme_void() + 
      ggtitle("theme_void()") 
```  
---
```{r purl=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
library(patchwork)
p1 + p2
```
---
```{r purl=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
library(patchwork)
p3 + p4
```
---
```{r purl=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
library(patchwork)
p5 + p6
```
---
```{r purl=FALSE, out.width="50%"}

```

# Working with Multi-Panel Plots 

---

- The `ggplot2` package has two nice functions, namely,  `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()` for creating multi-panel plots, called *facets*. 
- They are related but a little different: 
  - The command `facet_wrap()` creates essentially a ribbon of plots based on a single variable and
  - The command `facet_grid()` spans a grid of two variables.

---
#### Create a Multi-Panel Plots Based on One Variable

- The `facet_wrap()` command creates a facet of a single variable, written with a tilde in front: `facet_wrap(~ variable)`. 
- The appearance of these subplots is controlled by the arguments `ncol` and `nrow`:

---
```{r wrap-plots-1-row}
g <- ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
       geom_point(color = "blue") +
       labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
       theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))

g + facet_wrap(~ year, nrow = 1) #<<
```
---
- Accordingly, you can arrange the plots as you like as a matrix...

```{r }
g + facet_wrap(~ year, nrow = 2) #<<
```

---
#### Allow Scales to Roam Free

- The default for multi-panel plots in `ggplot2` is to use equivalent scales in each panel. But sometimes you want to allow a panels own data to determine the scale. This is often not a good idea since it may give your user the wrong impression about the data. But sometimes it is indeed useful and to do this you can set `scales = "free"`:


```{r out.width='30%'}
g + facet_wrap(~ year, nrow = 2, scales = "free") #<<
```

---
#### Create a Grid of Plots Based on Two Variables

 - In case of two variables, `facet_grid()` does the job. Here, the order of the variables determines the number of rows and columns:

---
```{r grid-plots}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "orangered", alpha = .3) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  facet_grid(year ~ season) #<<
```

---

- To change from row to column arrangement you can change `facet_grid(year ~ season)` to `facet_grid(season ~ year)`.
- The function `facet_wrap` can also take two variables and you are still able to control the grid design:

```{r out.width='30%'}
g + facet_wrap(year ~ season, nrow = 4, scales = "free_x") #<<
```

---
#### Create a Multi-Panel Plot Based on (Different) Plots

- There are several ways how plots can be combined. The easiest approach is the [`patchwork` package](https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork):

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = temp,
                       color = season)) +
        geom_point() +
        geom_rug() +
        labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)")

p2 <- ggplot(chicago, aes(x = date, y = o3)) +
        geom_line(color = "gray") +
        geom_point(color = "darkorange2") +
        labs(x = "Year", y = "Ozone")
```

---
```{r}
library(patchwork)
p1 + p2
```

---
- We can change the order by "dividing" both plots (and note the alignment even though one has a legend and one doesn't!):

```{r combine-plots-patchwork-2, fig.height=8}
p1 / p2
```

---
- And also nested plots are possible!

```{r combine-plots-patchwork-3, fig.height=6}
(g + p2) / p1
```

---
class: middle, center

# Add Text Annotations

---
- We can use `geom_text()` or `geom_label()` to add annotations to a ggplot. 


```{r out.width='30%'}
g <-
  ggplot(chicago, aes(x = temp, y = dewpoint)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Temperature (°F)", y = "Dewpoint")+
  geom_text(aes(x = 25, y = 60), #<<
                label = "This is a useful annotation") #<<
g
```

---
- By the way, of course we can change the properties of the displayed text:

```{r textbox-label-custom, warning=FALSE}
g +
  geom_text(aes(x = 25, y = 60),#<<
                label = "This is a useful annotation",#<<
            family = "Bangers",#<<
            size = 7, color = "darkcyan") #<<
```
