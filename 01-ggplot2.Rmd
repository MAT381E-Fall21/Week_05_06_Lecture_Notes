#### What Airbnb really does to a neighbourhood?

# Please read this article:  https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45083954
# Main points are: 
# Millions of people use Airbnb when travelling but its popularity sometimes puts it at odds with locals. 
# So, how do short-term holiday lets really affect a neighbourhood?

# In Manhattan's Lower East Side, for example, one study found that full-time Airbnb listings earned, 
# on average, two to three times the median long-term rent.

# The Los Angeles study indicated that, in 2014, almost half of Airbnb listings were clustered in seven neighbourhoods, 
# where rents increased a third more quickly than the city average. The wider US study suggested a 10% increase in Airbnb 
# listings led to a 0.42% increase in rents and a 0.76% increase in house prices.

# But the report also suggests that Airbnb profits from illegal rentals that "cause rent increases, reduce the housing supply, and exacerbate segregation".

# Aside from affordability concerns, some worry that a rapid expansion of short-term lets can alter an area's atmosphere.
# "This thing is changing the sense of place of the neighbourhood. It's changing the feel of it, with almost a revolving door 
# of strangers," one resident said.
# At other times, there have been complaints about short-term visitors' behaviour, including throwing loud parties or creating parking congestion.

# Many guests hope to save money versus a hotel or to have more "authentic" holiday experiences in less touristy neighbourhoods. 
# My research has found as many as 90% of Airbnb guests have said they were "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with their stays.


### Making histogram with ggplot: geom_hist().

# [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html) is a mission driven activist project with the objective to:
# Provide data that quantifies the impact of short-term rentals on housing and residential communities; 
# and also provides a platform to support advocacy for policies to protect our cities from the impacts of short-term rentals.
# By analyzing publicly available information about a city's Airbnb's listings, Inside Airbnb provides filters and key metrics so you can # see how Airbnb is being used to compete with the residential housing market.

# First, visit http://insideairbnb.com/istanbul/

# Then, import Istanbul Airnb Data published in September 2021 from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html.
# It considers the nightly price of about 23,019 Airbnb apartments in Istanbul in September 2021.
# Note that it is the "listings.csv" file published for Istanbul on September 30, 2021.
# The data disctionary is also available at
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWCNJcSutYqpULSQHlNyGInUvHg2BoUGoNRIGa6Szc4/edit#gid=982310896

# Histogram 
# The most common way to represent a unique numeric variable is with a histogram. 
# Basically, the numeric variable is cut in several bins: between 0 and 10 TLs a night, 
# between 10 and 20 and so on. This is represented on the X axis. 
# Then, the number of apartments per bin is counted and represented on the Y axis.

# Focus on the data where prices are less than 3000TL
# Draw a histogram of prices where binwidth is equal to 100,
# bin center is 50, and fill in the bins with color is #13c3d6 and bin border frame with black color.
# add main title, as well as x and y labels to the plot.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
airnb_data %>% 
    filter(price < 3000) %>% # we can combine dplyr function with ggplot2 through pipe operator
    ggplot(aes(x = price)) +
       geom_histogram() #bins: Defaults to 30.
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

## Bar Charts
########################################################################

# Bar charts are useful for displaying
# frequencies of categorical variables. 


#The OECD Affordable Housing Database presents a collection of available statistics on homelessness in member countries, in line #with definitions used in the corresponding national surveys. Estimates, in most cases, correspond to point-in-time estimates.
# In the visualization we provide an overview of cross-country estimates that are comparable in the sense that they all include #exclusively people in the following categories: (i) people living in the streets or public spaces without a shelter that can be #defined as living quarters; (ii) people in emergency accommodation with no place of usual residence, who move frequently #between various types of accommodation; and (iii) people living in accommodation for the homeless, including homeless hostels, #temporary accommodation and other types of shelters for the homeless.
# Let's focus on "Homeless data" at 
# https://ourworldindata.org/homelessness#:~:text=Homelessness%20remains%20an%20important%20policy,in%201%2C670%20Americans%20is%20homeless.
# We have number of homeless people for several countries in 2013.

Not in the same order! Order levels by magnitude! Then do it one more time!..
